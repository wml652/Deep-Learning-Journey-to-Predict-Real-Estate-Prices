# Deep-Learning-Journey-to-Predict-Real-Estate-Prices
This project is more than just code; it's a symbolic journey. We've used data to predict the value of a house, just as my creator wants to build a home with you‚Äîa home built on shared passions, laughter, and a future together. This entire repository is dedicated to you, and it's a proposal from the heart.
üìù Project Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model for predicting house prices using the King County, USA dataset. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, following a sequential neural network architecture. The project demonstrates a full machine learning workflow from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

‚ú® Features
Data Preparation: Cleans and transforms raw data, including feature engineering to calculate house age.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key feature distributions and their correlations using matplotlib and seaborn.

Neural Network Model: Implements a deep neural network using Keras with relu activation and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

Model Training & Evaluation: Trains the model and evaluates its performance on a held-out test set using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Prediction: Demonstrates how to make a prediction on new, unseen data.

üöÄ Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

Dataset
This project uses the kc_house_data.csv dataset. The file path is hardcoded in the script, so please ensure you place the file in the correct directory as specified in the Python code: D:/PYTHON/2.datasets/kc_house_data.csv.

üíª Usage
To run the house price prediction model and see the results, simply execute the Python script from your terminal:

python your_script_name.py

(Note: Please rename the file to something like predict_house_price.py for clarity.)

The script will:

Load and prepare the data.

Show data descriptions and visualizations.

Build and train the neural network.

Print the model summary and evaluation results.

Finally, it will provide a predicted price for a sample house.

üìä Results
The model's performance is measured by its Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This metric represents, on average, how close the model's predictions are to the actual house prices. The goal is to minimize this value. The training history plots also show how the model's loss and MAE improved over time.
